Apfelkuchen Recipe
A tasty German apple cake

3 cups of flour
2 sticks of butter
2 and 1/3 cups sugar
2 eggs
16-24 apples, peeled and sliced into thin wedges. 
*Slice them into a bowl of lemon juice and stir occasionally
*This takes forever. Do this part first
1 tbs vanilla
3 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt

1. Mix the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder)
Create a well in the center

2. Mix the wet ingredients (eggs, vanilla, butter) You can melt the butter if you desire
Add these into the dry ingredients, into the well in the center
You can leave the butter in stick form if you wish

3. Knead everything together by hand.
You want the dough to have a slightly tacky consistency, but not sticky.

4. Line a baking sheet with tin foil
Take 3/4 of the dough and smack it onto the baking pan. (put the other dough to the side)
Press it out to fill the full pan in an even layer. Press the dough upwards along edges too.
You are basically making the bed/crust for the apples.

5. Line the entire pan with lemon-soaked apple slices.
Lay them out in nice aligned layers, and stack them tightly.
Don't leave too many holes or empty areas, fill them with apples.

6. Take the remaining 1.4 of dough and roll it out.
Cut this into strips and lay them diagonally across the surface of the cake.
Lattice them together if you want.

7. Bake at 375 for about 45 minutes, or until golden brown on the top crust
